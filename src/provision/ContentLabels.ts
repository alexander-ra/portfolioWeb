    SWIFTNESS_APPROACH_LEFT = "Using pre-existing libraries can save development time, but it is not always recommended. It is rare that a project will need all the functionality that a given library provides, so the project becomes unnecessarily heavier. The biggest problem is that if a bug is found in the library, the development team has no control over fixing it. The best solution is to only use a complete library if absolutely necessary, and to fork and wrap it in new adapters to maintain independence. With my experience doing this, I can quickly understand new code, identify flaws, and integrate it effectively into the project.",
